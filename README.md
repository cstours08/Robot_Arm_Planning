 Weeks - 9
 
 We are planning to finish 1 week before Sprin Break to get a headstart on planning for our next project
 
 ### Week 1 (Jan 22 - 24)
This week we will start the code. We will code the different servos to our intended purpose. We will set up 5 servos coding each one for the specific function we want.
 
### Week 2 (Jan 27-31)
Finish up the code and if everything goes well we could start the box near the end of the week. 

### Week 3 (Feb 3-7)
Design box and make sure all measurements are correct, create box in SolidWorks.

### Week 4 (Feb 10 -14)
Start on Claw portion, figure out measurements and implement into CAD.

### Week 5 (Feb 17 - 21)
Finish Claw, Motion Study analysis on the claw, start on Base and Gear System.

### Week 6 (Feb 24 - 28)
Finish Base and Box, Continue work on gear system and start measurements for Arm.

### Week 7 (Mar 2 - 6)
Implement Arm into CAD, hopefully finish it, and do Motion Study if Possible on Assembly and also do a stress analysis to verify that our design is sturdy.

### Week 8 (Mar 9 - 13)
Start 3D printing and Laser Cutting, If all the pieces look good and are constructed correctly then we can Start the real life Assembly.

### Week 9 (Mar 16 - 20)
Finish Assembly, Troubleshoot it. once we have the real life assembly we will adjust the code slightly and the angles that our servo will turn.

### Week 10 (Mar 23 - 27)
Troubleshooting, and working on documentation. 

## Claw Design

We are using a claw design which many groups before us have used, I took a picture of one Dr. Shields made, and we are planning on having a design similar to that. The image on the right is a drawn design showing how we will try to construct ours.

## Inspiration

We are taking inspriation from Arleth & Eddy's Robot arm design with the base of their arm. We want a more gear based approach to it.

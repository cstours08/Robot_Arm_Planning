 Weeks - 9
 
 We are planning to finish 1 week before Sprin Break to get a headstart on planning for our next project
 
 ### Week 1 (Jan 22 - 24)

### Week 2 (Jan 27-31)
Finish up the code and if everything goes well we could start the box near the end of the week. 

### Week 3 (Feb 3-7)
Design box and make sure all measurements are correct, create box in SolidWorks.

### Week 4 (Feb 10 -14)
Start on Claw portion, figure out measurements and implement into CAD.

### Week 5 (Feb 17 - 21)
Finish Claw, Motion Study analysis on it, start on Base and Gear System.

### Week 6 (Feb 24 - 28)
Finish Base and Box, Continue work on gear system and start measurements for Arm.

Implement Arm into CAD, hopefully finish it, and do Motion Study if Possible on Assembly.

### Week 8 (Mar 9 - 13)
Start 3D printing and Laser Cutting, Start Assembly.

### Week 9 (Mar 16 - 20)
Finish Assembly, Troubleshoot it.

### Week 10 (Mar 23 - 27)

## Claw Design

We are using a claw design which many groups before us have used, I took a picture of one Dr. Shields made, and we are planning on having a design similar to that.
